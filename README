med.py
by Wendi Dunlap

med.py is a short and simple script for searching the Middle English Dictionary. The script defaults to Boolean search with full "open" results.

I do a lot of searching for research projects, and the default "closed" search results are never what I am looking for. So every single time I did a search I had to reload the page to load it in "open" format. It gets old.

So this script gives me a default search that suits my needs a bit.

1.0:

Functional if not pretty. Features: Boolean search with default "open" results, correct response (in console) to searches with empty results, correct response to single result searches, which are displayed differently on the OED site.
