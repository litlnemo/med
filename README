med.py
by Wendi Dunlap

med.py is a short and simple script for searching the Middle English Dictionary. The script defaults to Boolean search with full "open" results.

I do a lot of searching for research projects, usually researching medieval names, and the default "closed" search results are never what I am looking for. So every single time I did a search I had to reload the page to load it in "open" format. It gets old.

So this script gives me a default search that suits my needs a bit better. Maybe not of use for anyone else...

It uses the BeautifulSoup libraries.

1.0 (13 Sep 2013):

Functional if not pretty. Features: Boolean search with default "open" results, correct response (in console) to searches with empty results, correct response to single result searches, which are displayed differently on the OED site.

1.0.1 (14 Sep 2013):

Added ability to restrict search to pages that contain the term "surname." N.B. -- the MED usually marks surnames in a "surnames or place names" category, but not always! It is possible to miss something with this search for that reason. But for a quick search it works pretty well.

1.0.2 (30 September 2013):

Added loop, so you can search over and over again without rerunning the script. Added GUI dialog box using Pashua. Made app version with Platypus, using this script. Custom icon for the app version. Program now closes after you cancel search. Pages slightly prettier.
Removed restricted surname page search after deciding it's not very useful.
